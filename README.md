## Overview
**ps2dsoloader** brings the main functionality of the **dl** library to ps2sdk, inspired by the ERL system, enabling dynamic loading and runtime linking of modules for homebrew and runtime environments
Shared objects can be directly generated by the toolchain, add `-fPIC` when compiling and `-shared` when linking. the loader supports `-soname` and dependencies

## Features
- Dynamic loading of shared objects
- Runtime lazy symbol resolution, replaces loosy relocations from ERL
- Separate local and global symbol table

## TODO
- Dependencies
