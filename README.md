## Overview
**ps2dsoloader** brings the main functionality of the **dl** library to ps2sdk, inspired by and compatible with the ERL system, enabling dynamic loading and runtime linking of modules for homebrew and runtime environments.

Shared objects can be directly generated by the toolchain, add `-fPIC` when compiling and `-shared` when linking. the loader supports `-soname` and dependencies

Can be used by any standard library using `#include <dlfcn.h>`

## Features
- Dynamic loading of shared objects
- Loading of ERL libraries
- Runtime lazy symbol resolution
- ERL improvements 
- Separate local and global symbol table
